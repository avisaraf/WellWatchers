# WellWatchers

Please open up process_notebook.ipynb for the project process notebook, including our analysis. 

As instructed in the notebook, you will need to install MatPlotLib's Basemap in order to run visualizations. The first part of the data cleaning is done in clean_data.R, and the cleaned data from this process is in clean_training_set_map.csv and clean_training_set_values.csv. Two CSV files containing results were also loaded in and can be found at barchart.csv and pearson_chart.csv.
